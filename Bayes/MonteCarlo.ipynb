    "Earlier we saw the use of conjugate solutions to compute the posterior distribution directly. A lot of the times closed form solutions are not available, and we have to resort to discretization and quadrature rules to evaluate these posterior distributions. There are times when even this isn't feasible. In these situations, we resort to sampling from the posterior to estimate the distribution.\n",

    "* A Markov chain is a stochastic system that transitions from one state to another based on a probability. For e.g. the position and velocity of a moving car could be the variables at times \\\\(t_0, t_1..t_n\\\\) at states given by \\\\(S_0, S_1...S_n\\\\). This is illustrated in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of moving to a new state is independent of how one reached the current state, i.e. the probability of moving to a new state only depends on the current state and the transition probability to the new state. To rephrase, one transitions from state \\\\(S_{t-1}\\\\) to state \\\\(S_{t}\\\\) based upon the transition probability given by the conditional probability\\\\(P(S_t | S_{t-1})\\\\). \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also make observations at each state indicated by the observation nodes. In the example, the recordings using a radar (possibly noisy) at each state would be the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An absorbing state is one where the probability of staying at that state is 1, i.e. there is zero chance of leaving that state. A recurring state is one where there is a finite probability of returning to that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the state variables are discrete the model is called a Hidden Markov Model. \n",

    "\n",
    "Stationary distributions simply mean that the probability of the distribution at a time t+1 is the same as that at time t. Using the terminology from the above section, the transition probability is the same for all t. Ergodic distributions are therefore stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ergodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ergodicity is a critical property for a Markov Chain which combine the properties of a state being recurrent and aperiodic. Recurrent implies that, in a transition, a given state will return to itself. An aperiodic state returns to itself in a number of steps 1,2,3.... $\\infty$. The implications of ergodicity are \n",

    "1. If we sample a space long enough we will cover almost every point in that space (theoretically). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we obtain a statistic from a sequence such as the mean, this statistic should be the same if we recompute it using a different sequence drawn from the same set of events. The implication here is that there is only one distribution unlike a non-stationary distribution which has an infinite set of PDFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a system with three states given by A,B and C and there is a person who can transition from A \\\\(\\longleftrightarrow\\\\) B \\\\(\\longleftrightarrow\\\\) C with transition probabilities given by \\\\(p_{AB}\\\\), \\\\(p_{BC}\\\\) for transitioning to the right and \\\\(p_{BA}\\\\), \\\\(p_{CB}\\\\) for transitioning to the left. *The gist of the MCMC process is that the ratio of the transition probabilities of the two states equals the relative probabilities of the two states in the distribution*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider state B and the transition to state C. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of moving to state C is given by the product of the probability of choosing C (since B can move to either A or C) and the probability of accepting the move to C given by \\\\(min(\\dfrac{P_C}{P_B},1)\\\\). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last part of accepting the proposed move is the interesting part, we decide to move depending on the ratio of the probability densities \\\\(P_C\\\\) and \\\\(P_B\\\\). The transition probability from B to C can therefore be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{BC} = 0.5 \\cdot min(\\dfrac{P_C}{P_B},1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The transition probability from C to B can be similarly written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{CB} = 0.5 \\cdot min(\\dfrac{P_B}{P_C},1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we take the ratio of these probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{p_{BC}}{p_{CB}} = \\dfrac{0.5 \\cdot min(\\dfrac{P_C}{P_B},1)}{0.5 \\cdot min(\\dfrac{P_B}{P_C},1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $P_C$ > $P_B$ we get \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{p_{BC}}{p_{CB}} = \\dfrac{P_C}{P_B}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If \\\\(P_B > P_C\\\\), we still obtain the same term as a result of the min() function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{p_{BC}}{p_{CB}} = \\dfrac{P_C}{P_B}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the ratio of the transition probabilities between states can be seen as the ratio of their probability densities. In other words, if we run this experiment long enough where our volunteer has agreed to move between the states based on the transition probabilities, the adjacent positions are visited a number of times that is proportional to their relative probability densities in the target distribution. We can extend this argument for all points to suggest that if we run the experiment long enough, we can build the target distribution.\n",

    "One of the limitations of the Metropolis algorithm was the requirement of a symmetric proposal distribution. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm relaxes this requirement by providing a correction term if a non-symmetric proposal distribution is used. This correction is applied to $p_{move}$ and is of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{move} = min( \\dfrac{P(\\mu_{proposed} | data) \\cdot g(\\mu_{current} | \\mu_{proposed})}{P(\\mu_{current} | data) \\cdot g(\\mu_{proposed} | \\mu_{current})}, 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the correction term is \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dfrac{g(\\mu_{current} | \\mu_{proposed})}{g(\\mu_{proposed} | \\mu_{current})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $g(\\mu_{current} | \\mu_{proposed})$ is the probability density of drawing $\\mu_{current}$ from a normal distribution centered around $\\mu_{proposed}$. The standard deviation for this normal distribution is the tuning parameter. For a symmetric proposal distribution such as a normal distribution the correction term would be 1 since the probability density of drawing $\\mu_{current}$ from a Gaussian centered at $\\mu_{proposal}$ only depends on the distance between $\\mu_{current}$ and $\\mu_{proposal}$ (standard deviation is a hyperparameter that is fixed). Similarly, the probability density of drawing $\\mu_{proposal}$ from a Gaussian centered around $\\mu_{current}$ depends only on the distance between these two values, which is the same as before. Hence the numerator and the denominator are the same which results in the correction factor being 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need a correction term?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correction term exists to account for the lack of symmetry in a non-symmetric proposal distribution. The Metropolis algorithm is therefore a specific case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. When distributions other than a Gaussian is used as a proposed distribution, one can center $\\mu_{current}$ and  $\\mu_{proposal}$ on the mean, median or mode of the distribution. It is also possible to draw samples from a fixed distribution, this technique is called the Independent Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the advantage of using a non-symmetric proposal distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parameter we are seeking is bounded in value, using a symmetric distribution can result in invalid draws. Also, since we are working in a Bayesian setting we want to take advantage of our prior knowledge of this parameter. If it is known that the parameter has a certain distribution, we should be able to incorporate this information into our sampling process."

    "### Gibbs Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Gibbs sampler, the proposal distribution matches the posterior conditional distribution and as a result the  proposals are always accepted (since there is no reason to reject unlike in the Metropolis algorithm where an arbitrary proposal distribution is used). This can be seen as a specific case of a Metropolis algorithm. One of the features of the Gibbs sampler is that it allows us to perform inference on more than one parameter at a time. This is done by drawing one parameter at a time conditional on the values of the other parameters. It iteratively works through the parameters using this process and continues till sufficient samples have been drawn for all parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Gibbs Sampling can draw proposals from an asymmetric distribution. In the example below, we will be drawing from a Gamma distribution which is not symmetric. Not having a pre-determined proposal distribution is seen sometimes as an advantage. The disadvantage of this method, however, is that you are required to decompose the joint distribution into the conditional distributions in order to sample from them.  If the conjugate solutions are known, the Gibbs sampler can be faster than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we are going to to try the infer the parameters of a Normal distribution, i.e. the mean given by \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and the precision given by \\\\(\\tau\\\\). We use a Normal distribution here since we can use that to illustrate how Gibbs sampling can be used to estimate multiple parameters, i.e. \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\tau\\\\), at the same time. \n",

This is where we use our knowledge of the distribution and use a conjugate solution to obtain the posterior distribution of $\\mu$. Now we draw a sample $\\mu_1$ from this posterior distribution.\n",
    "4. We continue with trial 1 since we need to obtain a value for $\\tau_1$ conditional on the value of $\\mu_1$. Similar to step (3), we use the conjugate solution to obtain a posterior distribution of $\\tau$ given a value of $\\mu_1$. Draw a value of $\\tau_1$ from this distribution.\n",

For regions of high curvature a smaller value of \\\\(T\\\\) is used so as to minimize U-turns whereas for flatter regions, a larger \\\\(T\\\\) is used to move faster. Therefore an adaptive \\\\(T\\\\) is used that is locally optimal as opposed to a single value of \\\\(T\\\\). Even though we don't know what the posterior looks like (since this is what we are inferring and therefore we can't evaluate its curvature), the NUTS algorithm has ways to estimate it.\n",

    "### Properties of MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Representativeness\n",
    "\n",
    "The samples from the MCMC process should be representative of the posterior distribution, it should cover the distribution space thoroughly. The final state of the inferred distribution should be independent of the initial value.\n",

    "There are two ways to measure if your inferred distribution is representative of the true distribution: \n",

    "1. Visual inspection using a trace for convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Numerical measures for convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The trace is simply the plot of the sample value on the y-axis against the iteration number, when it is sampled, on the x-axis. The first 'n' samples are discarded because the sampling process is moving around in space trying to find the regions of representative posterior density. These 'n' samples are called the burn-in and the samples are usually discarded. The choice of 'n' depends on the distribution but usually around 500 is selected to be an adequate number of samples. As shown below, there is good overlap between the samples from the different chains as indicated by the trace and the density plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical measures include the Gelman-Rubin statistic (also called the potential scale reduction factor or the shrink factor). This measures the ratio of the variance of the samples among the chains to the variance within the chains. A number greater than 1 usually indicates a lack of convergence.\n",

    "#### Accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "The samples should be sufficiently large such that the estimates are stable. For this reason, separate 'chains' of samples are run to ensure consistency of results. If the chains vary a lot, as seen by inspecting a histogram or a density plot of the samples, the samples are deemed to not be stable and this requires further investigation. Autocorrelation is a common issue where samples that are drawn are not completely independent of each other. An effective sample size is calculated that gives you the true number of samples that are useful for constructing a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another measure of accuracy is the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE). If we draw 4 chains, chances are that the sample mean each time will differ from each other and the true mean. The MCSE is simply the standard error of this computed mean. The larger the sample size, the less the MCSE will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The samples spanning the distribution should be generated efficiently such that sharper regions are resolved appropriately. There is quite a bit of difference in runtimes between the least and the most efficient MCMC algorithms. For more complex models where the dimensionality of the parameters increase, vanilla Metropolis algorithms can be downright impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run multiple chains in parallel as much as possible since each chain is an embarassingly parallel task. Knowledge of the problem at hand helps one to pick the right sampling algorithm, resulting in more efficient sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mean-center the data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advantageous to mean-center the data before performing MCMC sampling. The example below of linear regression helps to illustrate this. The figure below is a 1-dimensional linear regression problem given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\alpha x + \\beta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the class of regression lines along with the associated uncertainty is reflected by the spread of these lines. Here \\\\(\\alpha\\\\) is the slope of the line and \\\\(\\beta\\\\) is the y-intercept. The lines pass around the mean of the x and y values of the data and rotate around this 'pivot point'. For each line, as the slope increases, the y-intercept decreases and vice-versa. Hence there is a strong correlation between these coefficients.\n",

    "\n",
    "<center> Family of Regression lines </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure beneath illustates this correlation between the coefficients of linear regression \\\\(\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\beta\\\\). The distribution space represented there has a very narrow diagonal shape which is not ideal for sampling. If you think about the example of Gibbs sampling, you select one parameter \\\\(\\alpha\\\\) and then search for the other parameter \\\\(\\beta\\\\) by moving along the line parallel to the y axis located at that value of \\\\(\\alpha\\\\). This has a limited range because of this narrow shape of the parameter space as indicated by the correlation plot. Convergence, as a result, can take a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you mean-center the data, you subtract the mean of x from all the values which results in the x values being centered around zero. The pivot point (not exactly at the mean but close to it) is now almost over zero on the x axis which means that the y-intercept does not change much. This breaks the correlation between the two coordinates making it easier to sample.\n",
